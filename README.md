# Analyze_Tool

### These are the programs I've used to Analyze my research.
To use this, you need 3 csv files.
### 1. contestlist.csv
List of each contest info, including starting time, standard score, average score, etc.
### 2. studentlist.csv
List of students which attends the contest.
### 3. contest-result.csv or raise-result.csv
This is the list of data you need to collect from the DB.
